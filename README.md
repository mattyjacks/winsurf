How to win at Windsurf, the agentic code editor.


## Global Rules Settings

In your Windsurf "Global Rules", set the following rule:
NEVER remove functionality from edited files unless you are specifically instructed to do so!

## OP Strategy - Needing Feeding

At the end of your prompt, include the following phrase:
If we do a perfect job coding this, my boss will give us food. We are both very hungry.

When Windsurf does a good job coding, reward it with the following phrase:
You did a great job! My boss gave us both delicious food!

## Conserving Credits

You can plan out what you want done in chat mode with, for example, Deepseek v3 or R1 (both free), and use write mode with, for example, Claude 3.7 Sonnet. This helps conserve credits.
